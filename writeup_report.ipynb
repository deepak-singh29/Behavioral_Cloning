    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to get the vehicle driven on track and within drivable area.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the NVidia arcitecture I thought this model might be appropriate because it was made to drive vehicle autonomously on different kind of tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting can be visualised while running the vehicle on track and most of the time the vehicle goes straight or left.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat the overfitting, I modified the model so that it can be trained for sharp left and right turns by using left and right camera images as recovery images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track like while taking left turn after bridge car was going straight off the track. To improve the driving behavior in these cases, I have tuned steering angle offset for left and right camera images and also to overcome the lag **Speed is been reduced to 4 in drive.py**.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Final Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes(model.py lines 101-119):\n",
    "* **Cropping layer**        : to crop unwanted details from data\n",
    "* **Lamda Layer**           : to preprocess(resize,normalize) the data\n",
    "* **Convolution Layer**     : 24 5x5 kernels\n",
    "* **Convolution Layer**     : 36 5x5 kernels\n",
    "* **Convolution Layer**     : 48 5x5 kernels\n",
    "* **Convolution Layer**     : 64 3x3 kernels\n",
    "* **Convolution Layer**     : 64 3x3 kernels\n",
    "* **Fully Connected Layer** : 5 fully connected layers to get steering angle as output\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture good driving behavior, I have used dateset provided by Udacity using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Center_Image](./originalImage.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to recover from left or right side of lane. These images show what a recovery looks like starting from left and right to center :\n",
    "\n",
    "Left Image :\n",
    "![Left_Image](./Left.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Right Image :\n",
    "![Right_Image](./Right.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Center Image :\n",
    "![Center_Image](./Center.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I repeated this process on track where we there are sharp turns in order to get more data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "To augment the data sat, I have used left and right images with angles thinking that this would help model learning the recovery path.For example, here is an image that has then been augumented as centre image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Left_Image](./Left.jpg)\n",
    " \n",
    "![Right_Image](./Right.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After the collection process, I had 6429 number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by cropping and prprocessing layer of model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image after cropping :\n",
    "![Cropped Image](./croppedImage.jpg)\n",
    "Resized Image :\n",
    "![Resized Image](./resizedImage.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 20% of the data into a validation set. \n",
    "\n",
    "I used this training data for training the model. The validation set help to determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 3 as evidenced by loss of around 0.022 I used an adam optimizer with learning rate 0.0009."
